<h2 id="grouping"> Grouping </h2>

<p>Students are required to form groups of 2 people. Each group will have 1 session of paper presentation and collaborate in the final project. Please form your group by the end of the first week.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<h3 id="note">Note Scribbing (30%)</h3>

<p>We'll have one student scribe the course note per lecture. In expectation, each student is required to scribe twice. We expect the student to finish the note within a week after the lecture. The assigned student should contact the TA after finishing the draft and the TA will help polish the draft. </p>
<p>The note for Monday's lecture is due on Friday.</p>
<p>The note for Wednesday's lecture is due on the next Monday.</p>
<p>Submission: Please submit the compiled PDF and also the source tex files to the TA via email. The TA will maintain a <a href="https://github.com/wuwuz/15893-notes"> github repo</a> for the source files.</p>
<p>Tips: You can copy the source files from the github repo and directly build from there. You can copy useful macros and reuse the existing reference entries from earlier notes. </p>

<h3 id="paper-reading">Paper Presentation (25%)</h3>

<p>Each group is required to present at least two relevant papers in one ~60min presentation. For the best case: (1) the two (or more) papers should be heavily connected; (2) the presentation will cover high-level ideas and also detailed techniques; (3) have interactive discussion. 
    The reasonable minimum is that each student presents one paper without coordination. Understandability of the presentation is the key to your grade -- please let your peers understand what are the "magic ingredients" of the papers. We will provide reading list soon.</p>

<h3 id="3-midterms-40">Final Project (35%)</h3>

<p> Each grup is required to explore a specific research topic, try to solve an open problem or improve some existing schemes (theoretically/systematically). Each group will have ~25min to present their progress at the end of the semester and is required to submit a project report. 
    We will provide some project ideas soon. 
</p>

<h3 id="participation-10">Participation (10%)</h3>

<p> We do require in-person attending. You can skip 20% of the lectures and still get full participation score.
    However, if you don’t show up and don’t email the TA, points may be deducted. </p>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>

<p><b>We will take academic integrity very seriously.</b>  Honesty and transparency are important features of good scholarship. Equally importantly, plagiarism and cheating are serious academic offenses with serious consequences. If you are discovered engaging in either behavior in this course, you will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question, and further disciplinary action may be taken. For a clear description of what counts as plagiarism, cheating, and/or the use of unauthorized sources, please see the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">University Policy on Academic Integrity</a> and the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/index.html">Carnegie Mellon Code</a> on Academic Integrity.</p>
